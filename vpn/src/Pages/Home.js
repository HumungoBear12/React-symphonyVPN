      <p>The <strong>Symphony VPN</strong> project is a senior IT initiative at Grand Canyon University (GCU), led by a team of students, including our team leader Arkelly, Andrew, and Cameron. The projectâ€™s goal is to design and configure a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution tailored for organizational use, with a focus on cybersecurity resilience.</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Key Features:</strong></li>
          <ul>
              <li>- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security</li>
              <li>- Ransomware detection to mitigate cyber threats</li>
              <li>- Robust administrative credential management to ensure secure access</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> Scrum</li><br/>
          <li><strong>Team Members:</strong><br/> - Arkelly (Team Leader)<br/>- Andrew<br/>- Cameron</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <p>The project follows the Scrum methodology, emphasizing iterative development, continuous feedback, and collaboration among team members. Scrum enables the team to break down the project into manageable sprints, allowing for frequent updates and adjustments based on testing and stakeholder input.</p>

      <p>The combination of cutting-edge security features with an agile approach ensures that Symphony VPN will deliver a highly secure and adaptable solution to meet the evolving needs of users. As the team progresses through the project phases, the focus remains on creating a scalable, efficient VPN system that enhances cybersecurity defenses while maintaining user accessibility and administrative control.</p>
